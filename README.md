dockyard
========

Dockyard is a factory for your Docker containers. It's the way to have Automated Builds 
(like on registry.hub.docker.com) for your own private Docker registry.

It also works better with Git, building off your Git tags so that you get corresponding
tags for your Docker repository.

Dockyard will support Git webhooks or (if you must) polling so that your build is 
triggered as soon as a new tag is pushed.

Coming soon, maybe...
